  <h1>Open Source Projects</h1>
  <p>
    I've contributed to a lot of open source projects - many of which are just one
    off contributions/fixes. Projects listed here are projects I'm actively
    involved with and build major parts of (or even all of it ;-) ). To see
    everything you might want to check out my
    <a href="https://github.com/PragTob">github profile</a>.

    <p>
      Shoes is a graphical toolkit for ruby - e.g. it enables you to write desktop
      applications with ruby. It features a beautiful DSL that allows you to
      easily create these applications. One of its main applications in my eyes
      is teaching beginners and especially kids how to program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shoes is my main open source project and the one I'm most attached to.
      It's the first open source project I ever contributed to, that was over 2
      years ago now. These days we are working on a rewrite called
      <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes4">shoes4</a>.

    <h2>after_do<a href="https://github.com/PragTob/after_do"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a></h2>
    <p>
      after_do is a tiny library to support Aspect Oriented Programming like
      techniques in Ruby. E.g. you can specify blocks to be executed after methods
      of specific classes are called. I wrote an <a href="http://pragtob.wordpress.com/2013/12/19/introducing-after_do-afterbefore-method-callbacks-in-ruby/">introduction blog post.</a>

    <h2>Rails Beginner Cheat Sheet <a href="http://pragtob.github.io/rails-beginner-cheatsheet/"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a></h2>
    <p>
      The Rails Beginner Cheat Sheet is just what it sounds like - a simple cheat sheet for people starting to learn rails. Through my coaching at Rails Girls Berlin and in the project group I noticed that there are several questions being asked over and over again. And certain commands that are hard to remember. So I went looking for cheat sheets but returned unsatisfied. Those cheat sheets were not made for beginners, they lacked explanations and were far to technical.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I created this cheat sheet hoping that it could help beginning Rails developers on their journey - remembering how to migrate the database, start the server and what exactly all those folders mean.

  <h1>Community projects</h1>
  <p>I like to go to numerous community events - be it user groups, conferences or just a get together - whatever. As such I sometimes hang around <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/">Open Tech School</a> events or some user groups. Communities listed here, are the ones I'm a regular at.</p>

    <h2>Ruby User Group Berlin (RUG-B)<a href="http://www.rug-b.de/"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a></h2>
    <p>Together with Thilo and Nico I organize the RUG-B. That entails finding a location/host, picking talks, keeping the website up to date, some moderation etc. And of course it entails a lot of fun. For me RUG-Bs are always too short as I want to talk to everyone but never can. RUGBs are on the first Thursday of every month (may be moved if that is a holiday).</p>

    <h2>Rails Girls Berlin<a href="http://www.railsgirlsberlin.de/"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a></h2>
    <p>I'm a regular coach at Rails Girls Berlin events, such as beginner/advanced workshops and hackdays, since summer 2012. I also usually give the introduction presentation. Moreover I coach a weekly project group, the rubycorns, together with <a href="http://tils.net/">Til</a> since march 2013.</p>
