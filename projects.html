<h1>Open Source Projects</h1>
<p>
  I've contributed to a lot of open source projects - many of which are just one
  off contributions/fixes. Projects listed here are projects I'm actively
  involved with and build major parts of (or even all of it ;-) ). To see
  everything you might want to check out my
  <a href="https://github.com/PragTob">github profile</a>.

  <h2><a href="http://shoesrb.com/>">Shoes</a></h2>
  <p>
    Shoes is a graphical toolkit for ruby - e.g. it enables you to write desktop
    applications with ruby. It features a beautiful DSL that allows you to
    easily create these applications. One of its main applications in my eyes
    is teaching beginners and especially kids how to program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shoes is my main open source project and the one I'm most attached to.
    It's the first open source project I ever contributed to, that was over 2
    years ago now. These days we are working on a rewrite called
    <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes4">shoes4</a>.

  <h2><a href="https://github.com/PragTob/after_do">after_do</a></h2>
  <p>
    after_do is a tiny library to support Aspect Oriented Programming like
    techniques in Ruby. E.g. you can specify blocks to be executed after methods
    of specific classes are called. I wrote an <a href="http://pragtob.wordpress.com/2013/12/19/introducing-after_do-afterbefore-method-callbacks-in-ruby/">introduction blog post.</a>

<h1>Community projects</h1>
<p>I like to go to numerous community events - be it user groups, conferences or just a get together - whatever. As such I sometimes hang around <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/">Open Tech School</a> events or some user groups. Communities listed here, are the ones I'm a regular at.</p>

<article id="rugb">
  <h2><a href="http://www.rug-b.de/">Ruby User Group Berlin (RUG-B)</a></h2>
  <p>Together with Thilo and Nico I organize the RUG-B. That entails finding a location/host, picking talks, keeping the website up to date, some moderation etc. And of course it entails a lot of fun. For me RUG-Bs are always too short as I want to talk to everyone but never can. RUGBs are on the first Thursday of every month (may be moved if that is a holiday).</p>
