<h1>Open Source Projects</h1>
<p>
  I've contributed to a lot of open source projects - many of which are just one
  off contributions/fixes. Projects listed here are projects I'm actively
  involved with and build major parts of (or even all of it ;-) ). To see
  everything you might want to check out my

  <p>
    Shoes is a graphical toolkit for ruby - e.g. it enables you to write desktop
    applications with ruby. It features a beautiful DSL that allows you to
    easily create these applications. One of its main applications in my eyes
    is teaching beginners and especially kids how to program.

    Shoes is my main open source project and the one I'm most attached to.
    It's the first open source project I ever contributed to, that was over 2
    years ago now. These days we are working on a rewrite called
    <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes4">shoes4</a>.
