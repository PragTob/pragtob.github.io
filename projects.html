  <h1 id="oss">Open Source Projects</h1>
  <p>
    I've contributed to a lot of open source projects - many of which are just one
    off contributions/fixes. Projects listed here are projects I'm actively
    involved with and built major parts of. To see
    everything you might want to check out my
    <a href="https://github.com/PragTob">github profile</a>.

  <article class="longform__section" id="benchee">
    <h2 class="longform__heading"><a href="https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee">benchee</a></h2>
    <p>
      benchee is a benchmarking library for elixir that provides a wealth of
      statistical data and is very extensible. The most prominent extension point
      is the ability to use different formatters for CSV, JSON and HTML output.

    </p>
    <p>
      Among others benchee also overs hooks, parallel execution, recording of
      previous results and much more. It's the standard benchmarking solution in
      the Elixir eco system.

    <h2 class="longform__heading"><a href="https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov">SimpleCov</a></h2>
    <p>
      SimpleCov is the default code coverage library in the Ruby ecosystem.
      It provides both line coverage and branch coverage, generating easy to read HTML
      reports as well as allowing you to write your own formatters.

  <article class="longform__section" id="shoes">
    <h2 class="longform__heading"><a href="http://shoesrb.com/">Shoes</a></h2>
    <p>
      Shoes is a graphical toolkit for ruby - i.e. it enables you to write desktop
      applications with ruby. It features a beautiful DSL that allows you to
      easily create these applications. One of its main applications in my eyes
      is teaching beginners and especially kids how to program.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's the first open source project I ever contributed to.
      Mostly working on a rewrite called
      <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes4">shoes4</a>.

  <article class="longform__section" id="after_do">
    <h2 class="longform__heading"><a href="https://github.com/PragTob/after_do">after_do</a></h2>
    <p>
      after_do is a tiny library to support Aspect Oriented Programming like
      techniques in Ruby. E.g. you can specify blocks to be executed after methods
      of specific classes are called. I wrote an <a
        href="http://pragtob.wordpress.com/2013/12/19/introducing-after_do-afterbefore-method-callbacks-in-ruby/">introduction
        blog post.</a>

  <article class="longform__section" id="rg-beginner">
    <h2 class="longform__heading"><a href="http://pragtob.github.io/rails-beginner-cheatsheet/">Rails Beginner Cheat
        Sheet</a></h2>
    <p>
      The Rails Beginner Cheat Sheet is just what it sounds like - a simple cheat sheet for people starting to learn
      rails. Through my coaching at Rails Girls Berlin and in the project group I noticed that there are several
      questions being asked over and over again and certain commands that are hard to remember. So I went looking for
      cheat sheets but returned unsatisfied. Most cheat sheets were not made for beginners, they lacked explanations and
      were far too technical.

  <h1 id="community">Community projects</h1>
  <p>I like to go to numerous community events, be it user groups, conferences or just a get together. Communities
    listed here, are the ones I'm actively involved with.</p>

  <article class="longform__section" id="rug-b">
    <h2 class="longform__heading"><a href="http://www.rug-b.de/">Ruby User Group Berlin (RUG-B)</a></h2>
    <p>I organize the Ruby User Group Berlin and have been doing so since ~November 2012. This entails finding a
      location/host, picking talks, keeping the website up to date, moderation etc. And of course it entails a lot of
      fun. For me RUG-Bs are always too short as I want to talk to everyone but never can.</p>

  <article class="longform__section" id="rails-girls-berlin">
    <h2 class="longform__heading"><a href="http://www.railsgirlsberlin.de/">Rails Girls Berlin</i></a></h2>
    <p>I'm a regular coach at Rails Girls Berlin events, such as beginner/advanced workshops and hackdays, since summer
      2012. Moreover I coach a weekly project group, the <a href="https://twitter.com/rubycorns">rubycorns</a>, together
      with <a href="http://tils.net/">Til</a> since march 2013 and we develop <a
        href="https://rorganize.it/">rorganize.it</a>.</p>
