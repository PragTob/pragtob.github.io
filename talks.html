<h1>Talks</h1>
<p>I like to give talks at numerous occasions. More specifically: conferences, user groups and workshops (for me mostly Rails Girls Berlin workshops). In this list you'll find talks I gave with the abstract and links to the slides - in general you find most of my slides at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pragtob" title="Speaker Deck">Speaker Deck</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PragTob" title="slideshare">slideshare</a>. If you want to know which conference I'm going to be at - check out <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/pragtob" title="Lanyrd">Lanyrd</a>!</p>

<h2>Code is read many more times than written</h2>
<p>
This statement changed my view of Software Engineering. Forever. Code is just written once, but read many times. This is why we should put extra effort into writing good code.
</p>

<p>
In this talk you will learn how to write readable code. Techniques and patterns will be presented to make your code as understandable and easy to work with as possible. Also higher level concepts to keep a code base nice, tidy and clean will be discussed.
  </p>

<p>
The ultimate goal of this session is to make your life as a programmer more enjoyable. Working with good code is just so much more productive and fun that it really makes a difference in your day-to-day job.
Writing readable code might be an investment, but it pays its interest rate every day.
