<h1>Talks</h1>
<p>I like to give talks at numerous occasions. More specifically: conferences, user groups and workshops (for me mostly Rails Girls Berlin workshops). This is a list of talks I gave with links to the slides - in general you find most of my slides at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pragtob" title="Speaker Deck">Speaker Deck</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PragTob" title="slideshare">slideshare</a>. If you want to know which conference I'm going to be at - check out <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/pragtob" title="Lanyrd">Lanyrd</a>!</p>
