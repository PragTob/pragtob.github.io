<h1>Talks</h1>
<p>I like to give talks at numerous occasions. More specifically: conferences, user groups and workshops (for me mostly Rails Girls Berlin workshops). In this list you'll find talks I gave with the abstract and links to the slides - in general you find most of my slides at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pragtob" title="Speaker Deck">Speaker Deck</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PragTob" title="slideshare">slideshare</a>. If you want to know which conference I'm going to be at - check out <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/pragtob" title="Lanyrd">Lanyrd</a>!</p>

<h2>Code is read many more times than written</h2>
<p>
This statement changed my view of Software Engineering. Forever. Code is just written once, but read many times. This is why we should put extra effort into writing good code.
</p>

<p>
In this talk you will learn how to write readable code. Techniques and patterns will be presented to make your code as understandable and easy to work with as possible. Also higher level concepts to keep a code base nice, tidy and clean will be discussed.
  </p>

<p>
The ultimate goal of this session is to make your life as a programmer more enjoyable. Working with good code is just so much more productive and fun that it really makes a difference in your day-to-day job.
Writing readable code might be an investment, but it pays its interest rate every day.

<h2>Shoes - The Ruby way to GUI applications</h2>
<p>We build web applications and command line applications with Ruby - but
  what about graphical desktop application? There used to be this <a href="http://www.shoesrb.com/">Shoes</a>
  thing, but isn't that <em>dead</em>?</p>

<p>No it's not! <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes4">Shoes4</a> is being developed
  right now by a dedicated team. Let me tell you all about it and introduce
  you to this beautiful DSL I fell in love with.</p>
<p>

<p>This presentation actually is a shoes application, with the slides described in a nice DSL. As it has no PDF export (yet) the slides are just screenshots :-)</p>

<h2>Web Workers - Heavy Lifting on the Client Side</h2>
<p>
  Web Workers are your possibility to do some of the heavy lifting
  on the client side without blocking the main thread and
  ever touching the backend!
  They are ready to use as all major browsers, yes even IE,
  support them. You can even write a
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/javascript-ray-tracer">ray tracer</a>
  purely on the client side of the browser. So it's time to get
  crazy and creative - this talk can get you started.

<h2>Introduction into web applications</h2>
<p>
  An introduction presentation I gave a lot of times at Rails Girls Berlin work shops and at my Rails course at the Humboldt university Berlin. It covers the basics of what web applications are and how the different parts of a web application play together.
